# eCon Noise Excel
 This is a repository for noise testing of electrical slip rings. The noise testing exports Excel sheets, but 200+ Excel sheets need to be combined at once and then graphs made corresponding to each column.

 The time in the excel sheet only shows the Min:Sec, but the csv file shows the entire time.
